				<p>The Azmeri resided in a chain of mountains in western Wraeclast known as the Azmerian Ranges. They had a primitive culture based on oral tradition. Their chieftains were selected by putting aspiring leaders through a labyrinth of beasts and traps to test their strength, wisdom, and spirit. The Azmeri worshipped their own gods, though many also worshipped the Vaal goddess Arakaali, and some (such as Tarcus Veruso) may have followed the Templar faith. Many of the Azmeri were enslaved by followers of the Vaal god Ralakesh long before the two civilizations established peaceful relations.
                <br><br>
                Around 900 BIC a Vaalish embassador made peaceful contact with the Azmeri, and for the next five hundred years the Vaal helped elevate their civilization into a cohesive culture of settlement, agriculture and literature. Following the Fall, the Azmeri took in the few Vaal survivors and integrated them into their civilization.
                <br><br>
                Four hundred years later, Tarcus Veruso led the Azmeri down from the mountains and into the ruins of the Vaal civilization, where he established the Eternal Empire. An inscription by the Order of the Djinn suggests that a young Azmerian named Egrin had visions that may also have been involved in leading the Azmeri down from the mountains.

				<p class="quotes">The Azmeri were the first culture known in history to use the trials of strength, wisdom, and spirit to select its chieftains.
                <br>
                The first Lord's Trial was a rough-hewn maze festooned with wild animals and brutal traps, crafted to test aspiring Azmerian leaders' body, mind, and soul.
                <br>
                In conquering the adversities of the maze, a champion proved they were capable of bearing the crushing burden of chieftainship.
                <br>
                The first trials were simple contraptions reflecting simple times. As the Azmerian civilisation grew in number and complexity, so did the trials, from treacherous mazes to bewildering labyrinths.
                <br>
                Alas, there are no surviving descriptions of the labyrinth that tested and proved the worth of Veruso, Prima Imperialus. I would imagine it was quite something to behold.

				<p class="quotes">The Azmeri were consummate survivors. They had to be, having been sired in the most inhospitable range of mountains in all of Wraeclast.
                <br>
                Unfortunate, some might say. I do not. I believe it was the making of them. And of us, their descendants.
                <br>
                So it is no wonder that they developed the Lord's Trial. With survival being a moment-by-moment concern, that harried people grew to understand power quite intimately.
                <br>
                Strong leadership is able to bridge the chasm between existence and extinction. Poor leadership might see an entire tribe vanish into that same chasm.
                <br>
                When the Azmeri descended from their mountains to conquer the fecund lands of central Wraeclast, they thrived and multiplied with utmost alacrity in those more forgiving climes.
                <br>
                For is it not poverty that teaches us how we might excel in times of plenty?
