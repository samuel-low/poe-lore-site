				<p>The Eternal Empire was first established in central Wraeclast, and at its height seems to have covered much of the continent including the Vastiri Plains, the Mantle, Phrecia, and all the way to the southern coast. It also included the island of Oriath, and following the Cataclysm Oriath was the only part of the empire to survive.
                <br><br>
                The empire was founded by the Azmeri and therefore may have kept much of the Azmerian culture and traditions. In its first years it continued the Azmerian practice of succession by labyrinth.
                <br><br>
                The Eternals are said to have revered the Azmerian goddesses Solaris and Lunaris "as the two eyes of their God," and their capital (Sarn) contained temples to both. However, the Eternals are also shown to have been associated with the Templars and their faith, with the High Templar vowing "to care for this Empire with eyes open" upon the coronation of each emperor.
                <br><br>
                The Templars appear to have their own culture and beliefs centered on the worship of the god Innocence, and their primary symbol is the descry. They may simply be a religious group rather than a separate race. Their origin is unknown, though as a group they seem to be older than the Beast since Innocence interacted with the first High Templar directly.
                <br><br>
                Their geographical origin is also unknown. It is possible the Templars were composed of Azmeri who followed Tarcus Veruso down from the mountains when he founded the Eternal Empire. It’s also possible they originated on Oriath, though since the Vaal lived there before the Fall this means the two groups would’ve coexisted on the island. It is clear that the Templars and the Vaal had some contact given that the Vaal also used the descry, as found on artefacts such as Zeel's Amplifier and Vaal totems.
                <br><br>
                The Templars were an integral part of the Eternal Empire from its inception, with the High Templar vowing "to care for this Empire with eyes open" upon the coronation of each emperor. Their seat of power may have been in Sarn (not Oriath), evidenced by the fact that High Templar Voll urged Kaom to invade and conquer Oriath during the Purity Rebellion. It isn’t known whether any Templars existed outside of the empire.
                <br><br>
                Since the Cataclysm and the empire’s collapse, the survivors on Oriath have had their own civilization, which appears to be a theocracy ruled by the Templars.

				<p>As the empire was founded by the Azmeri, the Eternals may have used the Azmerian language. Some examples of their writing:

				<p>Per Maramoa, the Templars on Oriath have their own language, called Oriathan. This language is not natively understood by the Azmeri remaining in Wraeclast, such as those in the Forest Encampment, and therefore may be different than the language used by the Eternal Empire. However, their writing appears similar to that of the Eternals, and they may have used the same alphabet:

				<p>No Oriathan words or phrases are known, though the above images contain possible examples. Oriathan seems to be the language in which most of the characters in the present communicate.
