				<p>The Maraketh are native to the Vastiri Plains in eastern Wraeclast, as far as is known. Their capital rests near a lake at the northern edge of the desert.
				<br><br>
				Their culture consists of a tribal matriarchy, and according to Vanja they have their own "unique cosmology of strange creatures, pagan gods and powerful treasures." They seem to be primarily desert-dwelling and practice pastoralism. The Maraketh often ride rhoas and may or may not ride rocs (Garukhan was said to have ridden one). They are referred to as dark-skinned by Victario.
